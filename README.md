## Welcome

Welcome to our Data Science take-home exercise!

The problem you will work on as part of this exercise is based on a real Data Science project at Polar Analytics. The dataset is representative, from a real life brand, though anonymised. 

In completing this work, you should feel free to work in whatever way is typical for you and use whatever resources you would have regular access to as a member of our team. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to send a message to alexis@polaranalytics.co

## Data Description
`data.csv` (available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZQ8Kj30A_heysk1NJlNLsFYJjkB7POQ0/view?usp=drive_link)) contains historical sales data by SKU with current levels of inventory. 
 
## Goal
The goal is to build a feature that would help brands with inventory planning.

Knowing when to buy stocks and ordering the right quantities is important for brands to avoid:
   
    1- missing out on sales because of OOS
    
    2- ordering too much (which costs money: warehouse seats, cash upfront)

## Requirements

Please develop a Python program that accomplishes the following:

- Demand Forecasting: generate SKU-level sales predictions to meet the goals outlined above. The model should provide predictions with sufficient lead time to allow for actionable decisions regarding inventory planning.

- Actionable Insights & Recommendations: restocking Strategy: Based on your modelâ€™s predictions, provide specific recommendations on when to reorder each SKU and in what quantity.

- Evaluation of Model Performance: Quantitatively assess the modelâ€™s accuracy in predicting SKU demand. Clearly communicate how well the model's predictions support the inventory planning goals.

- Considerations for Implementation: discuss any subjective design choices you made, such as feature selection, model selection, and parameter tuning. Provide an analysis of trade-offs related to these choices. 

## Deliverables

- Python Program: a runnable script that generates the predictions and recommendations as outlined above. Include appropriate documentation/comments within the code.

- Analysis Report: a Jupyter Notebook or equivalent presentation, detailing your approach, the rationale behind your decisions, and the performance evaluation. Ensure your analysis is comprehensive and communicates not only the technical aspects but also how the results can be used in a real-world inventory management context.
    


Please, push your work to a private git repo, and share it with these two users names: ALaks96 and charbelrseif

[IMPORTANT] It should contain a README file explaining how to run your code.

Thanks again, and have fun!

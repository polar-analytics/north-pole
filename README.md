## Welcome

Welcome to our Data Science take-home exercise!

The problem you will work on as part of this exercise is based on a real Data Science project at Polar Analytics. The dataset is representative, from a real life brand, though anonymised. 

In completing this work, you should feel free to work in whatever way is typical for you and use whatever resources you would have regular access to as a member of our team. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to send a message to charbel@polaranalytics.co

## Data Description
`data.csv` (available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZQ8Kj30A_heysk1NJlNLsFYJjkB7POQ0/view?usp=drive_link)) contains historical sales data by SKU with current levels of inventory. 
 
## Goal
The goal is to build a feature that would help brands with inventory planning.

Knowing when to buy stocks and ordering the right quantities is important for brands to avoid:
   
    1- missing out on sales because of OOS
    
    2- ordering too much (which costs money: warehouse seats, cash upfront)
    
## Output

Please build a python program that, when run, will do the following:

* Generate predictions of quantity sold by sku for the next 60 days. 
* Output, to a file, an appropriate quantitative estimate of the model's ability to correctly predict the metric

You may use any python modules, libraries, or frameworks you require.
Along with the program, please submit your analysis in a jupyter notebook, reflecting:
* any steps you took before modeling the data (e.g., data cleaning)
* the subjective design choices you made as part of the analysis (e.g., feature selection, model selection),
* what trade-offs these choices reflect, and
* what you might consider doing were you to spend more time on the challenge.

Please, push your work to a private git repo, and share it with charbelrseif

[IMPORTANT] It should contain a README file explaining how to run your code.

Thanks again, and have fun!

The north star team
